    "summary": "The genetic product of the groupoids, originating in the theory of DNA\nrecombination, is introduced. It permits a natural generalization of the\nclassical genetic algorithm. The full characterization of all three-element\ngenetic groupoids gives an approach to construct the new classes of genetic\nalgorithms. In the conclusion, we formulate some open problems in the theory of\nthe genetic groupoids.",
